Package: propeR
Title: An R tool for analysing multimodal transport
Version: 1.5.0
Description: An R tool for analysing multimodal transport based on a graph built using OpenTripPlanner (OTP).
  The generation of the OTP graph is based on a GTFS feed. The package includes a pre-OTP GTFS feed cleaner.
  The output functions include a: point-to-point map, which analyses from a single origin to destination;
  isochrone map, which analyses multiple destinations from multiple origins; and a choropleth map, which
  analyses journeys based on on Geojson polygon files. Each function can be run for a single time, or between
  start and end times, giving a more robust view of the journeys.
